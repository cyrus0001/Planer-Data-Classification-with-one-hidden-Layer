# Planar Data Classification with One Hidden Layer

This repository contains the code and resources for implementing a neural network with one hidden layer to classify planar data. The project aims to provide a hands-on example of building a simple neural network using Python and NumPy for classification tasks.

## Overview
In this project, we implement a neural network with one hidden layer to classify planar data. We use a simple neural network architecture consisting of an input layer, a hidden layer with a specified number of units, and an output layer with a single unit for binary classification. The model is trained using gradient descent optimization to minimize the cost function.

## Installation
